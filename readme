🚀 Performance Optimizations (Always On)
✅ Frame Throttling – Limits UI draws to 30 FPS.

✅ Hardware Acceleration – Uses GPU decoding when available.

✅ 720p Resize – Reduces decode load during export.

✅ Buffering + 250ms Chunks – Smoother recording and export.

✅ MP4 + Metadata – Ensures exported videos play correctly everywhere.

1. Upload a Video
File Upload: Choose a video file (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MKV – up to 1GB recommended).

Video Link: Enter a direct video URL (must end with .mp4, .webm, etc.).

2. Set Trim Points
Drag the Start and End sliders.

Type times manually (e.g., 1:23.45).

Use percentage inputs (0%–100%).

Click Set Start / Set End while playing.

3. Preview
Click Preview to play only the selected segment.

4. Adjust Settings
Volume: Increase/decrease export volume (0.5x–3x).

Speed: Change playback speed (0.25x–4x).

Audio: Mute, normalize, or adjust volume.

Video: Resize to 720p, choose MP4 or WebM.

5. Generate Captions

📦 Tech Stack
Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript

MediaRecorder API for video export

Web Speech API for captions

Canvas + AudioContext for audio processing

⚠️ Notes
Social media videos (YouTube, TikTok) will not work via URL upload – use file upload instead.

Best results: Use MP4, keep clips under 5 minutes, and enable all optimizations.

Browser support: Works best in Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.

🧠 Why It Doesn’t Freeze
Frame throttling prevents UI lock.

Small recording chunks (250ms) avoid memory bloat.

Hardware acceleration and buffering reduce CPU load.

Audio processing is done in a separate AudioContext.

Made with performance in mind. No server needed – everything runs in your browser.
